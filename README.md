# Communicate-data-findings

# Description

- This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.
- In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
- In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, I will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in my selected dataset. The primary method of conveying my findings will be through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
